**_Challenge:_**

The challenge of this application was using an unfamiliar technology (React Native) to build an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) application in a short timeframe (48 hours) and prepare a presentation to demonstrate a working prototype. Throughout the development process, I had to take careful consideration of the time it would take to learn and develop the various each segment of the application in order to complete this project on time.
